Minimal reproduction repository.
Issue link : [https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/3206](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/issues/3206)
Related to prisma, as this is my end goal here. Prisma added support for edge env recently, but their solution is limited to the node-postgres library working in this edge env too.

To start it, those commands are needed :
```bash
docker compose up -d
npm i
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

In the console, as well as on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should see the error pop.

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'

  78 |   if (config.sslcert) {
  79 |     config.ssl.cert = fs.readFileSync(config.sslcert).toString()
